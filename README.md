ROS-Spatula
===========
This file is a ROS package designed to incorporate a spatula into the PR2 robot model. 
My group with the Learning and Intelligent Systems lab at CSAIL is working to introduce more primitive behaviors into the 
PR2’s repertoire (such as serving things with a spatula) and then improving them with machine learning. 
This model allows the PR2 motion planning to base its decisions on the position of the spatula, and also allows user to 
visualize the spatula in the virtual robot model’s movements. My partner on the spatula project wrote code for vision of the 
spatula and objects to scoop, which can be viewed at https://github.com/xnie/PR2_Spatula_Vision . 
We worked together on hard coding the scooping motion, which can be 
viewed at https://github.com/xnie/PR2_arm_spatula_controller .
