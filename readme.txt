This file is a ROS package designed to incorporate a spatula into the PR2 robot model. My group with the Learning and Intelligent Systems lab at CSAIL is working to introduce more primitive behaviors into the PR2’s repertoire (such as serving things with a spatula) and then improving them with machine learning. This model allows the PR2 motion planning to base its decisions on the position of the spatula, and also allows user to visualize the spatula in the virtual robot model’s movements.
